# UE4 Datasmith - Set Mobility
[Python](https://www.python.org) script for [Unreal Engine 4 (UE4)](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/features) and [Datasmith](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/datasmith).</br>
The script changes the [mobility](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Actors/Mobility/index.html) of [Static Mesh Actors](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Actors/StaticMeshActor/index.html).</br>

Use the [Web Helper](https://github.andrewisen.se/UE4-Datasmith-setMobility/) to generate a Python file.</br>
Simply follow the instructions on the website and click "Download Python Script".

## Background
Given an [Autodesk Revit](https://www.autodesk.com/products/revit/overview) model. 
Assume one wants to create a game/application in UE4 where users can try interact with the world geometry. E.g. Try different room layouts by moving the furnitures around.

![Autodesk Revit 2020](docs/screenshots/screenshot-01.jpg?raw=true)

By using [Datasmith](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/datasmith), one could import said Revit file to UE4.

![Unreal Engine 4.24](docs/screenshots/screenshot-02.jpg?raw=true)

A problem occurs when working with the objects in the level.</br>

All imported Revit objects are stationary by defualt.</br>
Their movability should be **MOVABLE**.

![Mobility](docs/screenshots/screenshot-03.jpg?raw=true)

This scripts sets the mobility from **STATIC** to **MOVABLE** for all selected objects.</br>
In summary, one does not have to click on each individual object. 

## Getting Started
### Prerequisite
* [Unreal Datasmith Exporter for Autodesk Revit](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Content/Importing/Datasmith/SoftwareInteropGuides/Revit/InstallingExporterPlugin/index.html)
* [Unreal Engine 4.24 or higher](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/get-now)

N.B. Datasmith should be included with 4.24. [Read more](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Support/Builds/ReleaseNotes/4_24/index.html)

Make sure the `Python Editor Script Plugin` and the `Datasmith Importer Plugin` are enabled.

### Usage
1. Export Datasmith Content from Revit. See: [https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Content/Importing/Datasmith/SoftwareInteropGuides/Revit/ExportingDatasmithContentfromRevit/index.html](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Content/Importing/Datasmith/SoftwareInteropGuides/Revit/ExportingDatasmithContentfromRevit/index.html)
2. Import Datasmith Conent into EU4. See: [https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Content/Importing/Datasmith/HowTo/ImportingContent/index.html](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Content/Importing/Datasmith/HowTo/ImportingContent/index.html)
3. Enable Python in UE4.</br>
See: [Scripting the Editor using Python](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Editor/ScriptingAndAutomation/Python/index.html)</br>
</br>
4. Run the script in UE4 via `File->Execute Python Script`.

## Customize
### Mobility states
Set the mobily state by changing the variable:</br></br>
`mobility = mobilityStates[state]`</br></br>
where `state` is one of the following:
* 0 = STATIC
* 1 = STATIONARY
* 2 = MOVABLE

E.g. `mobility = mobilityStates[2]` sets the mobility to MOVABLE.

### Static Mesh Actors
Set which element categories should be affected:</br></br>
`metadataValues = ["Cat1", "Cat2", "Cat3"]`

E.g. `metadataValues = ["Furniture"]` will only affect objects that are categorized as *furnitures*.

## Built with
* [Python 3.7.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-372/)
* [Unreal Python API](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/PythonAPI/index.html)
